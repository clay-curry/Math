# Preface

In the pursuit of understanding nature, symmetry and invariance have been used to great effect. It has long been known that certain laws of nature are symmetric and invariant under certain transformations, and that these symmetries can often provide insight into how the world works. The induction of models of naturally occurring systems has naturally motivated much interest and work on the problem of how to constrain the space of admissible hypotheses to include only those guaranteed to respect desired symmetries. One of the most important tools for achieving this is the use of group theory, Lie groups, and Lie algebras, which allow us to fully characterize sets of transformations that leave certain systems or physical quantities invariant. While Lie theory is increasingly being used in the machine learning literature, there is often a wide gulf between the presentations of the subject: research papers that get down to business quickly but are often imprecise and inconsistent in definitions and statements of theorems, versus math books which often have an impossibly steep barrier to entry.

It is my hope that this book will be useful to both mathematicians, scientists, engineers, and data analysts. Using only linear algebra, Part I of the text covers the basics of linear representations and reducibility, tensor products of representations, the compact group approach to representation theory, Clebsch-Gordan Theory, and the Wigner-Eckart Theorem. Part II of this text will present the lineage of recent work in equivariant neural networks, particularly geometric graphs, and will be demonstrated using Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning. Part III is yet to be determined.

These notes are compiled for a general (mathematically-inclined) computer science audience, where the prerequisites include a basic understanding of linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and familiarity with the Python language and its machine learning libraries. My hope (not expectation) is that someone will find these notes to be an enlightening case of, yet another, topic in pure math diffuse into the applied.
