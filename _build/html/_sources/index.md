# Introduction

These notes provide a formal, applied mathematical introduction to cutting-edge developments at the interface of abstract algebra, harmonic analysis, and artificial neural networks. Under a relatively-small set of mathematical principles, these notes provide a unified perspective of several neural architecures likely to drive a new age of breakthroughs in computer science.  Importantly, these notes will equip the reader with a mathematically rigours toolkit for the motivated construction of new architectures yet to be invented.
