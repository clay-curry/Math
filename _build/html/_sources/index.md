These notes provide a formal, applied mathematical survey of fundamental methodological developments in the construction of neural networks, particularly at the interface of group representation theory and non-commutative harmonic analysis (collectively known as "Fourier Analysis"). After a brief introduction to Fourier analysis and its impact on mathematics, we will discuss the implications of non-commutative algebraic structures incorporated in recently published deep learning architectures (in mostly chronological order).  Importantly, these notes will develop a unified mathematical description of several recent published techniques that, in the humble opinion of the author, are likely to fundamentally transform the role of computers in the natural sciences and civilization.

Being written for a general (mathematically-inclined) computer science audience, these notes will equip the dedicated student with a mathematically rigorous toolkit for that can be immediately used in construction of new neural architectures. These notes attempt to provide an accessible introduction to abstract mathematics,  and state-of-the-art engineering methods making up the science and art of deep learning of today. The necessary prerequisites for success in this survey are a basic understanding of linear algebra, a basic understanding of calculus, some familiarity with the Python language and its machine learning libraries, and a unfettered thirst for understanding.

I hope you find these notes useful and enjoy the journey.
