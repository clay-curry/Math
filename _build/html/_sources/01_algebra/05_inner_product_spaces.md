# Inner Product Spaces

Thus far, we have developed intuition and theorems for understanding the *algebraic structure* of *vector spaces* and *linear maps*. This knowledge will enrich our present discussion, wherein we develop a theory of *inner products* and *inner product spaces*. Unlike all previous insight insofar concerned with  ***algebraic*** notions, inner products permit us to study ***geometric*** notions of vector spaces and linear maps, such as "length," "projection," and "orthogonality."
