# Symmetry

The mathematical group and group theory are a pillar of modern mathematics and physics. This feat is a direct consequence of the following truth: 

<div style="text-align:center;"><b>groups</b> encapsulate the <b>algebraic structure</b> underlying all <b>symmetries</b>.</div>
<br>

This section motivates the study of groups by revisiting notions of sets, operations on sets, relations between sets, and equivalence relations..

## Sets

Sets are not merely defined as a collection of elements. Sets are defined by their elements and by the mathematical structure that glues elements together in any meaningful sense (ordering, summation, multiplication, orientation, etc.)

````{prf:definition} Set
:label: set

The *set* $S$ is the collection of all objects $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ that individually share the property of *existence* in $S$, denoted by, 

$$
s_1, s_2, \ldots \in S.
$$

````

Elements may be any kind of mathematical objects, including numbers, lists of numbers, mappings (functions) between sets of numbers, and even other sets.

## Relations

Relations and operations mathematically characterize the various kinds of structures that could exist between mathematical objects.
Relation can also describe a connection between two elements of different sets. Operations provide a way to discuss and view arbitrary elements by combining or manipulating other elements of a set. Together, these concepts form the foundation of many branches of mathematics and are used to define mathematical objects such as groups, vector spaces, and fields.

## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
