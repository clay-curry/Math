    "all linear maps between arbitrary finite-dimensional vector spaces. Vector spaces are a generalization of the description of a plane using two coordinates, as published by Descartes in 1637. Like groups, the theory of linear maps holds for an entire class of examples, where results are uncoupled from any particular cases. We start with the following axiomatic definition.\n",

    "On first introspection, it is natural, perhaps tempting, to glance over a handful of deep, subtle requirements that {prf:ref}`linear-map` imposes regarding the structure of $V$ and $W$.

In other words, if a map $f : V \\to W$ is a linear mapping, then we are implicitly assuming that $V$ has a well-defined summation structure $+_V : V \\times V \\to V$ and scalar-multiplication structure $\\cdot_V : \\mathbb \\times V \\to V$ compatible with $f$. Likewise, by assuming the existence of a linear map $f: V \\to W$, we also require the existence of a summation structure $+_W : W \\times W \\to W$ and a scalar multiplication structure $\\cdot_W : \\mathbb{F} \\times W \\to W$ so that $f$ may satisfy the additivity and homogeneity structure defined in {prf:ref}`linear-map`. Thus, if one wishes to build a solid theory of linear maps, we are motivated first to consider what types of *sets* linear maps can be well-defined over.\n",
