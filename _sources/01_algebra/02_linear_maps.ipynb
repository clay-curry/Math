    "This section serves to help the reader begin to appreciate the above statement. To start, we will ponder the central object of study in linear algebra, linear maps. Like groups, linear maps are developed as an axiomatic theory, where results are guaranteed to hold for an entire class of mathematical objects (in contrast to one particular mathematical object). We start with the following axiomatic definition.\n",

    "On initial introspection, it is natural, perhaps tempting, to glance over a subtle condition of Definition {eq}`linear-map`.  Linear maps constitute a class of group morphisms compatible only with vector spaces.\n",
