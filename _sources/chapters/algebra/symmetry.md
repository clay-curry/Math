# Symmetry

Forever fused by Newton, the allience of higher mathematics and modern physics have irreversably altered our relationship with the universe. \[write something here\]

This feat is a direct consequence of the following truth:

<div style="text-align:center;">
<b>groups</b> are a <b>formal language</b> for describing <b>symmetries</b>.</div>
<br>

Much like derivatives and the notion of infinitesmal change, groups give us a mathematical structure that extend our ability to understand and leverage symmetries. Thus, before going forward, our first goal is to understand, precisely, the modern mathematical attempt to understanding the meaning of "symmetry."

Precisely, this section motivates the study of groups by revisiting notions of sets, relations, mathematical structure, operations on sets, operators on sets, equivalence relations, and symmetry. This is followed by some basic results proved from the group axioms, cosets, isomorphisms, and group actions.

## Cosets & Normal Subgroups

## Homomorphisms & Isomorphism Theorems


Sets are not merely defined as a collection of elements. Sets are defined by their elements and by the mathematical structure that glues elements together in any meaningful sense (ordering, summation, multiplication, orientation, etc.)

````{prf:definition} Set
:label: set

The *set* $S$ is the collection of all objects $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ that individually share the property of *existence* in $S$, denoted by, 

$$
s_1, s_2, \ldots \in S.
$$
````

Elements may be any kind of mathematical objects, including numbers, lists of numbers, mappings (functions) between sets of numbers, and even other sets.


Relations and operations mathematically characterize the various kinds of structures that could exist between mathematical objects.
Relation can also describe a connection between two elements of different sets. Operations provide a way to discuss and view arbitrary elements by combining or manipulating other elements of a set. Together, these concepts form the foundation of many branches of mathematics and are used to define mathematical objects such as groups, vector spaces, and fields.

## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
