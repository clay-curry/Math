# Introduction

These notes are compiled for a general (mathematically-inclined) computer science audience, where the prerequisites include a basic understanding of linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and familiarity with the Python language and its machine learning libraries. My hope (not expectation) is that someone will find these notes to be an enlightening case of, yet another, topic in pure math diffuse into the applied.
