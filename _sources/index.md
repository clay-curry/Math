# Intro

These notes provide a formal, applied mathematical introduction to cutting-edge developments at the intersection of abstract algebra, harmonic analysis, and artificial neural networks. From first principles, this thesis presents recent popular neural architectures, notably at the intersection of physics and computer science, aiming to derive such architectures under a small unifying set of principles. In essense, this thesis seeks to compile constructive methods for designing new architectures yet to be invented.
