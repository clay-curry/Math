# Preface

The construction of learning algorithms capable of modeling natural systems (e.g., protein folding, sythesis design, biomarker disovery), has motivated much work on the problem of how to constrain the space of admissible hypotheses to include only those guaranteed to respect desired symmetries. One of the most important tools for achieving this is the use of group theory, Lie groups, and Lie algebras, which allow us to fully characterize sets of transformations that leave certain systems or physical quantities invariant.

As group theory continues to let us look deeper into black box, the tendency speak in increasingly abstract mathematics coincides with even steeper barriers to entry while actively stalling adoption in other sciences, deincentivizing follow-on works, obscuring the path forward. To make matters worse, this knowledge divide has affected the ranks of conferences reviewers (sorry [AnonReviewer3](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1gBhkBFDH&noteId=BJgI5GfF9B)), and, in the most eggregious case (if you know, you know), seeing masterpieces get rejected by peer-review

Research papers get down to business quickly but are often imprecise and inconsistent in definitions and statements of theorems. Math books which often have an impossibly steep barrier to entry. For this one narrow topic, my goal is to offer the best of both avenues. Admittedly, I cant do this alone; suggestions are welcomed out of necessity rather than courtesy.

In Part I, we will to develop the theory of linear representations and reducibility, tensor products of representations, the compact group approach to representation theory, Clebsch-Gordan Theory, and the Wigner-Eckart Theorem. Part II of this text will present the lineage of recent work in equivariant neural networks, particularly geometric graphs, and will be demonstrated using Pytorch Lightning. Part III is yet to be determined.
